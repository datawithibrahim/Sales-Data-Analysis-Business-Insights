# Sales and Customer Dashboard Documentation & Data Driven Decision Making 

In this dashboard project, I have built a comprehensive visualization tool to analyze sales and customer data across multiple dimensions including time, product categories, and geography. Using the datasets available, I have extracted meaningful insights to guide business decisions and highlight performance patterns.

## Profit Analysis

In the profit analysis section, the dashboard shows monthly profits for the current year (2023), allowing users to observe fluctuations and identify critical periods for deeper investigation.

| Month     | Profit ($)   |
|-----------|--------------|
| January   | 1,919.18     |
| February  | -824.33      |
| March     | 577.72       |
| April     | 1,698.88     |
| May       | 785.28       |
| June      | 287.37       |
| July      | 703.48       |
| August    | 2,592.99     |
| September | 2,232.64     |
| October   | 1,470.66     |
| November  | -930.56      |
| December  | -2,634.41    |

From this, one can see two months with negative profit — November and December — which signals potential issues like heavy discounting or seasonal cost overruns. Addressing these months can improve overall yearly profitability significantly.

## Product Subcategory Comparison

This dashboard highlights sales versus profit performance by product subcategory, showing percent changes year-over-year and helping identify growth areas.

| Subcategory  | Sales CY 2023 ($) | Profit CY 2023 ($) | YoY Sales Growth (%) |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Phones       | 102,875.98        | 12,671.92          | +32.67              |
| Chairs       | 92,944.62         | 7,672.10           | +12.48              |
| Binders      | 72,491.22         | 7,878.91           | +46.39              |
| Storage      | 67,737.58         | 7,459.88           | +15.62              |
| Tables       | 59,238.12         | -7,295.16          | +0.96               |
| Accessories  | 59,023.26         | 15,618.28          | +43.08              |
| Appliances   | 42,926.93         | 7,865.27           | +66.49              |
| Machines     | 42,848.70         | -2,325.23          | -22.99              |

This analysis reveals Phones leading in sales and yielding a strong profit margin, making it a prime candidate for marketing investment. Conversely, Tables and Machines show profit losses despite reasonable sales, pointing to areas requiring cost control or product strategy reassessment.

## Sales Trend Overview

The sales trend section aggregates monthly sales data for the year 2023 and compares it to the previous year (2022), revealing significant growth in key months.

| Month      | Sales CY 2023 ($) | Sales PY 2022 ($) | YoY Sales Growth (%) |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| January    | 9,431.88          | 1,756.30          | +437                |
| February   | 626.72            | 601.72            | +4                  |
| March      | 2,785.49          | 1,174.27          | +137                |
| April      | 4,915.51          | 2,714.67          | +81                 |
| May        | 2,923.87          | 1,166.08          | +150                |
| June       | 2,354.45          | 778.66            | +202                |
| July       | 2,463.93          | 1,911.12          | +29                 |
| August     | 12,873.22         | 1,068.08          | +1105               |
| September  | 12,101.07         | 9,579.86          | +26                 |
| October    | 10,130.76         | 6,640.08          | +52                 |
| November   | 6,429.07          | 4,918.76          | +31                 |
| December   | 5,455.24          | 17,209.59         | -68                 |

Particularly notable is the extraordinary sales surge in August (+1105%) which may point to successful campaigns or product launches. December’s sales decline (-68%) is a red flag for seasonal planning and resource adjustment.

## Weekly Sales KPIs

Weekly averages provide insights into the rhythm of sales activity, useful for operational resource planning:

| Week | Avg Sales ($) | Avg Profit ($) |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 1     | 2,127.15     | 631.72        |
| 8     | 1,545.25     | 675.13        |
| 27    | 2,782.10     | 1,593.55      |
| 32    | 2,645.24     | 424.35        |
| 52    | 5,781.75     | 478.80        |

Week 52 spikes signal holiday-related demand, justifying increased staffing and inventory planning.

## Business Insights and Recommendations

From the data in the dashboard:

- Address the substantial profit losses in November and December by reviewing price discounting policies or logistics costs during these months.

- Prioritize marketing and inventory for product lines like Phones and Accessories, which demonstrate strong profitability and year-over-year sales growth.

- Investigate cost inefficiencies in Tables and Machines line items, which show significant negative profit despite steady sales.

- Utilize the remarkable performance in August to plan promotional activities or inventory stock for similar seasonal opportunities.

- The weekly sales spike towards year-end indicates the need for operational readiness in logistics and customer service.

## Strategic Implications and Business Decision Framework

Using the insights derived from this Sales and Customer Dashboard, several strategic initiatives and decision-making frameworks can be built to foster sustainable growth and operational excellence:

### 1. Pricing and Promotion Strategy

The negative profits in November and December highlight the risk of excessive discounting or operational inefficiencies during holiday seasons. Strategies include:

- Implement dynamic pricing models that adjust according to demand elasticity and competitor pricing.

- Limit deep discount campaigns unless tied to clear acquisition or retention goals.

- Use A/B testing to measure the impact of promotions on profit margins before large-scale deployment.

### 2. Product Portfolio Optimization

Sales and profit data by subcategory reveal which products to prioritize or rationalize. Strategies include:

- Allocate marketing spend and inventory focus to high-margin, high-growth categories like Phones and Accessories.

- Conduct cost-benefit analysis for maintaining underperforming categories (Tables, Machines) and consider options such as product redesign, supplier renegotiation, or phased discontinuation.

- Launch targeted cross-selling campaigns for accessory products with proven profitability.

### 3. Seasonal and Campaign Planning

Significant sales surges in certain months (August, January) and weekly spikes (Week 52) inform resource allocation. Strategies include:

- Develop marketing calendars aligned with high-sales periods identified in the data.

- Bolster inventory and increase fulfillment capacity ahead of these peaks.

- Plan staffing and customer support ramp-ups in sync with projected demand spikes to maintain service quality.

### 4. Customer Segmentation and Retention

Although specific customer metrics are not detailed here, integrating RFM or similar segmentation within the dashboard supports tailored strategies. Strategies include:

- Use customer segmentation for personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and churn prevention.

- Prioritize engagement efforts on high-value and at-risk segments to maximize lifetime value and reduce churn-related revenue losses.

### 5. Operational Efficiency

Weekly sales variability suggests opportunities for lean operations. Strategies include:

- Implement flexible workforce scheduling to adjust to sales fluctuations.

- Utilize just-in-time inventory management to reduce holding costs while meeting demand.

## Decision-Making Summary

- Increase prices cautiously during profit-draining periods, linking raises to cost drivers analysis.

- Invest in top-performing product lines for maximum ROI.

- Align marketing and operational plans with sales seasonality to capture market opportunities efficiently.

- Adopt customer data-driven approaches to enhance engagement and retention.

- Continuously monitor KPIs to dynamically adjust strategies based on evolving data trends.

By translating dashboard insights into these actionable strategies, businesses can improve profitability, optimize resource allocation, and strengthen competitive positioning in the market.
